This romhack will add new tracks, chars, music, sprites and other misc things. Hopefully, gonna feel like a different game than Mario Kart at the end! Only time knows... 

Super cup DEMO: Let's u play the first cup and changes some misc things (like item distributions). It also adds joke names for the characters! (Placeholder until the new characters get added). NOTE: The "Work In Progress" cups are vanilla, but u may notice some curious color palettes if u play them. Check them out!
